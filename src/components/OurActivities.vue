                                        In KYAFS parliamentary sessions, political actors are invited and given time to
                                        respond to the resolutions made during the plenary session. These sessions have
                                        documented significantly improved debate techniques and the policy influence in
                                        Society.

                                        Youth Assemblies have also exposed youth to programs, opportunities and benefits
                                        that have enhanced their political, socioeconomic, cultural, intellectual,
                                        moral, spiritual and leadership development. Capacity building programs have
                                        strengthened their skills and knowledge on democratic values, such as tolerance,
                                        participation, dialogue, inclusion, consensus building and cooperation.
                                        These skills have enabled youth to consolidate democratic principles and values,
                                        whilst positioning them as credible local actors that contribute to local
                                        governance and benefit from public trust. Leveraging on these capacities, youth
                                        from local assemblies have been incorporated into the sub- national government's
                                        technical planning, oversight and implementation structures where they have been

                                        The intergenerational youth leadership and political mentorship initiative has
                                        not been fully embraced in Kenya. Youths find it challenging to engage in active
                                        politics and rights claims as they cannot build networks, manage expectations,
                                        identify between the right and best person in politics, mobilize support and win
                                        public trust.
                                        Another big challenge for youth today is the identity question linked to the
                                        rapid urbanization that has occurred since the 1980s. It is also linked to the
                                        pauperization of urban youth, increasingly marginalized; many youths have been
                                        recruited to join Al-Shabaab as suicide bombers from the suburbs. The youths
                                        robbed of a future and of support, often float between "drugs and piety." They
                                        form easy prey for fundamental radical Islamism and political violence. KYAF
                                        focus is more on peacebuilding, youth unemployment, co-existence, political
                                        fanatics and religious extremism. </div>

                                        in the 2010 Kenyan Constitution, however, they are still considered to have
                                        inadequate education and training that fail to prepare them adequately to

                                        structures within both national and county government. On the other hand, the
                                        youth's perception that their voice would not be heard; Lack of information on
                                        available avenues for participation in governance, fear and the belief among the
